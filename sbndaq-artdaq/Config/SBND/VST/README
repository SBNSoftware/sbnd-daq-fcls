Configuration files for running artdaq in the Vertical Slice Test.

To be ported to tests at DAB???

Three directories:
DAQInterface -- configuration files and scripts for running DAQInterface
NOTE: Paths are currently hard-coded to lariat-daq04 -- we'll probably want to change things for DAB

ArtdaqConfig -- fhicl configuration files for running artdaq
  ConfigA is set to run Nevis Readout Electronics w/ 10 FEMB's
  
bin -- associated scripts to run the DAQ
